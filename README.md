# Hierarchical-hetero by Toviah Moldwin, Menachem Kalmenson, and Idan Segev, 2022.

All code to run the experiments found in "Asymmetric voltage attenuation in dendrites can enable hierarchical heterosynaptic plasticity" can be found here.

For help downloading and running NEURON, see Oran Amasalem's tutorial here: https://github.com/orena1/NEURON_tutorial

To run an experiment, start by downloading the folder titled 'experiment_scripts', and choose the experiment you want to run. 
Name of script will be the name of the figure it is presented in.

Example: to run the experiment that creates the traces seen in Figure 3A2-A5, open script 'fig_3a_2to5', choose the parameters you want, and run script. 

It is suggested to download all the scripts in the main file, as they are used in the running of the experiments.
